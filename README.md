Gesture Recognition with OpenCV
---


#### Execute a command with a given gesture
##### Nice gesture launcher with only opencv and python
##### We were inspired by this [page](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/solutions.html) and this [blog](https://dojang.io/mod/page/view.php?id=2393).

2. Points to Note
i. We need to know how computers judge our gestures.
